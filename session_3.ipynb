    "### Introduction\n",
    "In the world of finance, the ability to efficiently manipulate and analyze vast amounts of data is crucial. Financial data, whether it be stock prices, trading volumes, or economic indicators, often comes in large, complex datasets that need to be processed quickly and accurately. This is where Pandas and NumPy, two powerful Python libraries, come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NumPy** provides the foundation for **numerical computing** in Python. Its support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a rich collection of mathematical functions, allows for the efficient computation of complex financial models. Whether you're calculating returns, risks, or optimizing portfolios, NumPy enables these operations to be performed quickly and with minimal code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pandas**, on the other hand, is built on top of NumPy and is specifically designed for **data manipulation and analysis**. It introduces data structures like Series and DataFrames, which are ideal for handling tabular financial data. Pandas makes it easy to clean, filter, aggregate, and analyze time series data, which is a common task in finance. With Pandas, you can effortlessly transform raw data into actionable insights, enabling more informed decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, Pandas and NumPy form the backbone of financial data analysis in Python, empowering finance professionals and engineers to tackle a wide range of challenges, from simple data exploration to building complex financial models.\n",
